<h3>This addon permits you to render your scene created with animation nodes without crashes.</h3>


After installed you'll find the button in the Properties panel.

Just press the button, it will render the animation frames set in your timeline, frame by frame.

It works only with sequence images (jpg, png, ect). If you choose, e.g. a video extension will not work.
